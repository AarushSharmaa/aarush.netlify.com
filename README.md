Hi Everyone, This is a very simple portfolio built using **HTML** and **CSS**. 
For anyone who is starting out in their HTML and CSS journey, these codes can be helpful.

**HTML is the language which describes the content and structure of the web pages**.
**CSS is the extension to the HTML which modifies the design and display of the web pages**
